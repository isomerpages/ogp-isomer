### The process
While all whitelisted government emails are currently able to log into IsomerCMS through their emails, **currently it is not possible to create an Isomer website independently through IsomerCMS**. Agencies need to fill in a form to create an Isomer website.

The time required to setup a new website can vary, ranging from 36 hours to 6 months, depending on the size of the site and your agency's internal processes. 

##### 0. Prepare and buy a domain
It's recommended to get a domain on ITSM before getting a new Isomer website to ensure that you can get the domain that you want.


##### 1. Let us know you're interested

[Send us an email telling us more about your website](mailto:support@isomer.gov.sg). If your use case matches our capabilities, we'll generate a new website template for you.


##### 2. Log into [cms.isomer.gov.sg](https://cms.isomer.gov.sg/sites) to start editing
You can add other collaborators to your site through IsomerCMS. 

##### 3. Launch your website

You will be guided on how to launch your website independently. Learn more about the [site launch process in our guide](https://guide.isomer.gov.sg/)
