##### How do I edit my website content? Do I need to know coding?

#####  What are my options if I am unable to use Isomer?

Your agency can consider using the [Singapore Government Design System](https://www.designsystem.gov.sg/).

The Singapore Government Design System is a collection of UI components and design patterns that were built with the best UX practices in mind. The purpose of the design system is to provide the public with a unified experience across all public-facing government digital services.

Do note that for the Singapore Government Design System (SGDS), your agency will be responsible for developing, hosting, maintaining the website and ensuring that the website is compliant to the IM8 and DSS.

Isomer’s design components are also extracted from SGDS. We’re working closely with them to ensure that necessary UI components are aligned with what they have.

Design systems are widely used around the world today:

- In Industry: [Google Material design](https://material.io/design/), [Adobe Spectrum](https://theblog.adobe.com/author/the-spectrum-design-team/)
- In Government: [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/), [Gov.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/), [Australian Design System](https://designsystem.gov.au/)

Alternatively, you can also consider using CWP, which is part of the WOG bulk tender.

#####  How do I back up my site for archiving purposes?

To keep a copy of your site content offline, you can download it in a zip file. To do so, follow the steps belowGo to your repository, usually with the URL github.com/isomerpages/agency-site 1. Click on the Code button 2. Select Download Zip option

##### Can I launch a non gov.sg domain?

##### I am not a public officer, can I use Isomer?

#####  Can I track individual buttons and clicks on Isomer?

#####  Can I restrict editing access to specific pages?

##### I don’t see a layout or component that I want to use in IsomerCMS. Can you do it for me?

No, the Isomer team does not offer this service. While we understand that some users may have specific design requirements, we do not do custom designs for individual websites.

To allow us to scale, we maintain the Isomer template and periodically add new functional templates and components after doing thorough research to ensure that they meet good design standards, and are implemented with accessibility in mind.

If you have a component or template layout that you would like to see on IsomerCMS, let us know your use case here.

##### Why don’t we have carousels?

A carousel is a type of slideshow to display multiple images or pieces of content in a single location. Each image usually is accompanied by an action button.

Carousels have been proven to be ineffective in converting visitors to an action. A study conducted found that the click-through rate significantly reduced after the first image. They can also lead to a poor user experience if a carousel rotates too quickly or contains too many images, it can be difficult for users to focus on any one piece of content. Additionally, carousels can be less accessible for users with disabilities, such as those who rely on screen readers to navigate websites. [Read the research through this article](https://medium.com/@sherpadesignco/carousels-are-killing-your-conversion-rate-heres-how-to-fix-that-b57e31f8f508)

As such, we don’t believe that carousels are the best way to show content to site visitors. We suggest alternative ways to display information .
