##### I am not a public officer, can I use Isomer?

Only emails ending with .gov.sg and other whitelisted domains can log into IsomerCMS.

However, if you're interested in Isomer and would like to explore its capabilities, you can refer to [our Github Repository](https://github.com/isomerpages). Our codebase is open source, meaning that you can use our templates or framework for your own development purposes.

##### Can I hire external vendors to manage my Isomer website?

Yes, but the **Isomer team does not liase directly with vendors**. All communication **must** go through an agency representative. We do not  explain the product to vendors on an agency's behalf.

- We cannot meet with them to explain how the product works
- Any queries from a vendor should be directed to the agency representative.
