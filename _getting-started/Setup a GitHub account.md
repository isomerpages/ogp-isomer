If you're being added to a website that uses GitHub ID login, you must set up a GitHub account in order to be added as a collaborator to edit the website on IsomerCMS.

The images in this guide may be outdated but the overall steps remains the same.


### 1. [Create a GitHub account](https://guide.isomer.gov.sg/setup/github-account#sign-up)

Use your preferred email address and a set a professional username. Follow the steps to retrieve the code sent to the email you used. You can set any preferences based on what makes sense to you, these do not impact your Isomer experience.

### 2. Turn on 2-Factor Authentification

Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on your account can block up to 99% of automated attacks. To ensure the security of our users, Isomer requires all users to enable 2FA on their accounts.


[Follow the steps listed here to enable your 2FA](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication) . Note that you can pick any method of authentification out of TOTP, SMS, or security key.

> CAN WE RECCO [SMS](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication)?

GitHub will prompt you to save your recovery codes. The purpose of these codes are to guarantee you are the owner of your account in case your 2FA fails, such as when you lose your phone.

We strongly encourage saving these codes somewhere secure.

### 3. Request for access to Isomer's GitHub

After setting up your 2FA, you will need access to your site to start editing it on IsomerCMS.

- [Fill in this form to request for access to an Isomer site](https://go.gov.sg/isomer-access). **You will receive an invite to your registered email** once we've added you to the repository.

- **Click on the link in your email** and accept the invitation by clicking on ***Join Isomer***.
