**As an agency, you are responsible for all content, management and maintenance of your Isomer website.** This includes:

- Migrating all content from your old website to your new Isomer website
- Creating and updating content such as text or images
- Approving and publishing any content changes
- Ensuring that your website content meets Digital Service Standards (DSS)
- Maintaining website administrators and regularly removing inactive users

These can all be done through IsomerCMS.

**Isomer will be responsible for website hosting, maintenance, support, and ensuring compliance with relevant clauses of the IM8, DSS, and UC.** We are here to ensure that your website is up and running smoothly, and offer training and technical support if you encounter any issues.

> We do not offer website design services, and are unable to provide custom designs or layouts for your website.

### Support and cost 
- The Isomer service is free for agencies and officers to use, but **you will need to cover the cost of your domain URL**, which you can get from IT Service Management (ITSM).

- You can add a vendor as a collaborator on your website, but **you are responsible for all communication with, and actions of, your vendors.** The Isomer team will not directly liaise with any vendors. 

- Isomer Support is able to help with technical assistance of the CMS and simple markdown or HTML debugging, **but will not be able to debug complex customisations of the Isomer template CSS.**

- Your website needs **at least 1 other public officer** to approve and publish any changes. The Isomer team cannot approve these changes for you.


### Compliance
- **Agencies do not need to be responsible for any IM8 clauses. By using Isomer, your site is _by default compliant_ to all applicable IM8 clauses.** The Isomer Team manages all security centrally, including any security testing (i.e. VAPT etc) and audits/tests. In the event that any IM8-related queries come along, we will sort it out separately with the IM8 team. 
You can reach out to [Isomer Support](mailto:%20support@isomer.gov.sg) for further clarification on specific clauses.
- Internal Risk Assessment Checklist is not applicable to Isomer (?) as part of the security review for compliance with IM8

- **Isomer has placed restrictions on certain actions to follow government compliance regulations,** such as disallowing the deletion of required pages (e.g. privacy, terms of use).
