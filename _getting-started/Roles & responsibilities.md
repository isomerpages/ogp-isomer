**Agencies are responsible for all content, management and maintenance of their Isomer website.** This includes:

- Migrating all content from your old website to your new Isomer website
- Creating and updating content such as text or images
- Approving and publishing any content changes
- Ensuring that your website content meets Digital Service Standards (DSS)
- Maintaining website administrators and regularly removing inactive users

These can be done through our Content Management System, IsomerCMS. [Learn more about IsomerCMS]()

**Isomer will be responsible for website hosting, maintenance, support and ensuring compliance to relevant clauses of the IM8, DSS and UC.** We are here to ensure that your website is up and running smoothly, and we provide technical support if you encounter any issues.

Isomer also provides the following services:

- Technical support and assistance with usage of IsomerCMS through our support channels
- Training of how to use IsomerCMS on request

> We do not offer website design services, and are unable to provide custom designs or layouts for your website.

Instead, Isomer maintains a central template that offers some basic customisation that users can leverage on to begin building their website.



    

### Support and cost 
- The Isomer platform and service is free for Public Officers to use, but in order to launch their site, **agencies must bear the cost of the domain URL**, which you can procure from IT Service Management (ITSM).

- Isomer allows Public Officers to add vendors as collaborators to their website, but **agencies are responsible for all communication with and actions of their vendors.** The Isomer team will not directly liaise with any vendors. [View our FAQs on vendor management]()

- **Agencies are responsible for migrating any existing content from a previous website** to their Isomer website. The Isomer team cannot provide this service for you.

- Isomer Support is able to help with technical assistance of the CMS and simple markdown or HTML debugging, **but does not entertain debugging requests for complex customisations of the Isomer template CSS.**

- Each website should have at least 2 Public Officers added to it. To publish changes to your website, a colleague needs to approve your changes. The Isomer team does not do this approval for you. [Learn more about review requests]()


### Compliance
- **Agencies do not need to be responsible for any IM8 clauses. By using Isomer, your site is _by default compliant_ to all applicable IM8 clauses.** The Isomer Team manages all security centrally, including any security testing (i.e. VAPT etc) and audits/tests. In the event that any IM8-related queries come along, we will sort it out separately with the IM8 team. 
You can reach out to [Isomer Support](mailto:%20support@isomer.gov.sg) for further clarification on specific clauses.
- Internal Risk Assessment Checklist is not applicable to Isomer (?) as part of the security review for compliance with IM8

- **Isomer has placed restrictions on certain actions to follow government compliance regulations,** such as disallowing the deletion of required pages (e.g. privacy, terms of use).
