##### Do I need to know coding to edit my website?

You don't have to be familiar with HTML or CSS to edit a page on Isomer. Instead, you'll use a text editor with basic editing features. The text is formatted using [markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/), which uses simple symbols and characters to indicate formatting.

The Homepage, Contact Us page, and Navigation bar use a block editing system with modules and blocks, rather than open text. The team is working to make this editing experience available for all pages, so users won't have to use markdown.


##### Can I launch a non gov.sg domain?
Yes you can. Please consult your ITD on this.

##### Can I use WOGAA or VICA on Isomer sites?
Yes, you can. For AskJamie and VICA, drop us an email, share your code snippet and we'll configure it for you. 

For WOGAA, you can refer to [our guide on setting up analytics](https://www.notion.so/analytics-and-tracking). 


**Does Isomer support Google Tag Manager (GTM)?**
Unfortunately no. The reason is because the use of GTM violates the Content Security Policy (CSP) we've set up to protect your site from SQL Injection or XXS attacks.However, you can explore the use of Facebook Pixel, find our more [here](https://www.notion.so/analytics-and-tracking/google-analytics#facebook-pixel).

##### Can I integrate or embed things on pages?

Yes, you can add VICA chabots and embed services such as youtube videos with an iframe. View our advanced integrations for a full list.

##### I don’t see a layout or component that I want to use in IsomerCMS. Can you do it for me?

No, the Isomer team does not offer this service. While we understand that some users may have specific design requirements, we do not do custom designs for individual websites.

All our templates and components are implemented after doing thorough research to ensure that they meet good design standards, and are kept accessible.

##### Custom code

Typical custom code such as HTML will reflected on the CMS preview but there may be issues which we do not expect, you can report it to us through [go.gov.sg/isomer-cms-help](http://go.gov.sg/isomer-cms-help).

##### Markdown/Kramdown table

When you have missing title on your Markdown/Kramdown table, the preview of your table on the CMS will not be displaying correctly. Don't be alarmed, and you may check your staging link to verify that that your table is displaying properly

Still have an issue but not listed here? Report to us [here](https://go.gov.sg/isomer-cms-help).

##### Why don’t we have carousels?

A carousel is a type of slideshow to display multiple images or pieces of content in a single location. Each image usually is accompanied by an action button.

Carousels have been proven to be ineffective in converting visitors to an action. A study conducted found that the click-through rate significantly reduced after the first image. They can also lead to a poor user experience if a carousel rotates too quickly or contains too many images, it can be difficult for users to focus on any one piece of content. Additionally, carousels can be less accessible for users with disabilities, such as those who rely on screen readers to navigate websites. [Read the research through this article](https://medium.com/@sherpadesignco/carousels-are-killing-your-conversion-rate-heres-how-to-fix-that-b57e31f8f508)

As such, we don’t believe that carousels are the best way to show content to site visitors. We suggest alternative ways to display information .

##### What are my options if I am unable to use Isomer?

Agencies can consider hosting your website on CWP as part of the CWP bulk tender, or an external provider e.g. AWS Cloudfront. You can also use the [Singapore Government Design System](https://www.designsystem.gov.sg/) for UI components. In this case, your agency will be responsible for developing, hosting, maintaining the website and ensuring that the website is compliant to the IM8 and DSS, as well as any costs for these services.
