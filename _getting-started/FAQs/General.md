##### Do I need to know coding to edit my website?

No, you do not need to know HTML or CSS. When you edit a page on Isomer you use a rich text editor with basic editing capabilities.  pages use markdown.

To edit the Homepage, contact us page, or navigation bar, we use a block editing system where 
The team is looking into extending this block editing function to all Isomer pages to remove even the need to use markdown.

##### Can I launch a non gov.sg domain?
Yes you can. Please consult your ITD on this.

##### What analytics does Isomer offer?

You may have questions like these:

How many people visit my website?

Which pages on my website are the most popular?

What content do my visitors like the most?

To give you a better understanding of how your visitors are viewing your site, you need to set up analytics on your site.

##### Can I integrate or embed things on pages?

Yes, you can add VICA chabots and embed services such as youtube videos with an iframe. View our advanced integrations for a full list.

##### I don’t see a layout or component that I want to use in IsomerCMS. Can you do it for me?

No, the Isomer team does not offer this service. While we understand that some users may have specific design requirements, we do not do custom designs for individual websites.

All our templates and components are implemented after doing thorough research to ensure that they meet good design standards, and are kept accessible.

##### Custom code

Typical custom code such as HTML will reflected on the CMS preview but there may be issues which we do not expect, you can report it to us through [go.gov.sg/isomer-cms-help](http://go.gov.sg/isomer-cms-help).

##### Markdown/Kramdown table

When you have missing title on your Markdown/Kramdown table, the preview of your table on the CMS will not be displaying correctly. Don't be alarmed, and you may check your staging link to verify that that your table is displaying properly

Still have an issue but not listed here? Report to us [here](https://go.gov.sg/isomer-cms-help).

##### Why don’t we have carousels?

A carousel is a type of slideshow to display multiple images or pieces of content in a single location. Each image usually is accompanied by an action button.

Carousels have been proven to be ineffective in converting visitors to an action. A study conducted found that the click-through rate significantly reduced after the first image. They can also lead to a poor user experience if a carousel rotates too quickly or contains too many images, it can be difficult for users to focus on any one piece of content. Additionally, carousels can be less accessible for users with disabilities, such as those who rely on screen readers to navigate websites. [Read the research through this article](https://medium.com/@sherpadesignco/carousels-are-killing-your-conversion-rate-heres-how-to-fix-that-b57e31f8f508)

As such, we don’t believe that carousels are the best way to show content to site visitors. We suggest alternative ways to display information .

##### What are my options if I am unable to use Isomer?

Agencies can consider hosting your website on CWP as part of the CWP bulk tender, or an external provider e.g. AWS Cloudfront. You can also use the [Singapore Government Design System](https://www.designsystem.gov.sg/) for UI components. In this case, your agency will be responsible for developing, hosting, maintaining the website and ensuring that the website is compliant to the IM8 and DSS, as well as any costs for these services.
