##### Do I need to know coding to edit my website?
No, you do not need to know HTML or CSS. When you edit a page on Isomer you use a rich text editor that gives you buttons to 

where you can use markdown sym

Markdown is a plain text format, it can be easily edited using any text editor, making it a flexible and versatile option for editing text.

#####  What are my options if I am unable to use Isomer?

Agencies can consider hosting your website on CWP as part of the CWP bulk tender, or an external provider e.g. AWS Cloudfront. You can also use the [Singapore Government Design System](https://www.designsystem.gov.sg/) for UI components. In this case, your agency will be responsible for developing, hosting, maintaining the website and ensuring that the website is compliant to the IM8 and DSS.


#####  How do I back up my site for archiving purposes?

To keep a copy of your site content offline, you can download it in a zip file. To do so, follow the steps belowGo to your repository, usually with the URL github.com/isomerpages/agency-site 1. Click on the Code button 2. Select Download Zip option

Only emails ending with .gov.sg and other whitelisted domains can log into IsomerCMS.

However, if you're interested in Isomer and would like to explore its capabilities, you can refer to our Github Repository. Our codebase is open source, meaning that you can use our templates or framework for your own development purposes.

#####  Can I track individual buttons and clicks on Isomer?

#####  Can I restrict editing access to specific pages?

##### I don’t see a layout or component that I want to use in IsomerCMS. Can you do it for me?

No, the Isomer team does not offer this service. While we understand that some users may have specific design requirements, we do not do custom designs for individual websites.

To allow us to scale, we maintain the Isomer template and periodically add new functional templates and components after doing thorough research to ensure that they meet good design standards, and are implemented with accessibility in mind.

If you have a component or template layout that you would like to see on IsomerCMS, let us know your use case here.

##### Why don’t we have carousels?

A carousel is a type of slideshow to display multiple images or pieces of content in a single location. Each image usually is accompanied by an action button.

Carousels have been proven to be ineffective in converting visitors to an action. A study conducted found that the click-through rate significantly reduced after the first image. They can also lead to a poor user experience if a carousel rotates too quickly or contains too many images, it can be difficult for users to focus on any one piece of content. Additionally, carousels can be less accessible for users with disabilities, such as those who rely on screen readers to navigate websites. [Read the research through this article](https://medium.com/@sherpadesignco/carousels-are-killing-your-conversion-rate-heres-how-to-fix-that-b57e31f8f508)

As such, we don’t believe that carousels are the best way to show content to site visitors. We suggest alternative ways to display information .
