#### Can I hire external vendors to manage my Isomer website?

Yes you can. Isomer is designed to be simple enough for officers to manage themselves, even without any coding knowledge. But we understand that sometimes you need additional help.

However, the **Isomer team does not liase directly with vendors**. All communication **must** go through an agency representative. We do not  explain the product to vendors on an agency's behalf.

- We cannot meet with them to explain how the product works
- Any queries from a vendor should be directed to their agency contact

**You can add a vendor as a collaborator to your website through IsomerCMS.** If you have trouble adding them as a collaborator, contact Isomer support.

#### Can I restrict editing access to specific pages?
No you cannot. All collaborators on your website have edit access to all pages on an Isomer website. 

However, there are other restrictions in place based on your account role. Learn more in our guide.

#### I am not a public officer, can I use Isomer?

**Only emails ending with .gov.sg and other whitelisted domains can log into IsomerCMS.** If you are interested in Isomer and would like to explore its capabilities, please refer to [our Github Repository](https://github.com/isomerpages). Our codebase is open source, which means that you can use our templates or framework for your own development purposes.
