There are 3 parts to an Isomer website:
1. The Isomer template
2. Isomer's infrastructure
3. IsomerCMS

Our pre-designed **Isomer template** is hosted on our **infrastructure**, which can be edited through the **IsomerCMS**.

The Isomer team centrally manages the Isomer template and infrastructure, while Public Officers only need to access the IsomerCMS to make edits to their website.
