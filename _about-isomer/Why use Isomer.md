Isomer believes that websites are an important way for the government to share information with citizens. As such, we want to enable any public officer to **set up a good website easily without any prior coding or design knowledge.** Here's how Isomer makes it easy:

### 1. It meets all compliance requirements

- ##### No need for a tender or AOR
	Because Isomer is an internal government tool, the service is free to use.

- ##### No need to do your own VAPT
	Since all sites on Isomer share the same infrastructure and pull from a central template, there is no need for multiple VAPTs or security reviews.

- ##### IM8 compliant by default
	Just by using Isomer, you've already covered all applicable Instruction Manual 8 (IM8) clauses.

All of this helps when you need to launch a website quickly. 

### 2. Standard templates for quick launch

Don't worry about designing a website entirely from scratch. Choose from a range of lightweight components and templates to design a quick, clean website that's customised to your needs. 

##### In line with [Singapore Government Design System (SGDS)](https://designsystem.tech.gov.sg/)

Isomer's components follow standards set by SGDS, which ensures that your website automatically keeps good user interface and experience practices.

### 3. Easy-to-use CMS to manage your content

IsomerCMS allows you to add, edit and publish content yourself without the need for a third party. It only takes a few minutes for you to make changes to your website.
