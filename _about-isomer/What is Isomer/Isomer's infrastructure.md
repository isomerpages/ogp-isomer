&gt; Each Isomer website is actually made up of 2 sites: *Staging* and *Production*.

<br>

- **Staging is like an intermediate version of your live website.** It's used to preview content changes and updates without affecting the live website.
	- Clicking 'save' on IsomerCMS will **reflect the changes on your staging site, but not production**.
	- Page previews in IsomerCMS only allow you to preview that particular page. **On your staging site, you can click around and navigate across pages** like in your live site.
	- You can **share your staging site link** with colleagues or stakeholders to preview new content, without them having to log into IsomerCMS. 

- **Production is the live version of your website** that is publicly accessible to site visitors.
	- A colleague **must approve all the changes in staging in order to publish them** into your production site. You can do this by Requesting a review on IsomerCMS.
	- Note that approval and publishing is for ALL content on your staging site, across all pages. **Currently you cannot selectively approve and publish changes for a particular page.**
