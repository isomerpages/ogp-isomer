&gt; Each Isomer website is actually made up of 2 sites: *Staging* and *Production*.

<br>

- **Staging** is like an intermediate version of your live website. It's used to preview content changes and updates without affecting the live website.
	- You can share this staging site with colleagues or stakeholders to preview new content.
	- Page previews in IsomerCMS only allow you to preview that particular page. On your staging site, you can click around and navigate across pages like in your live site.
	- 'Saving' any changes on IsomerCMS will be reflected on your staging site, but not production.

- **Production** is the live version of a website that is publicly accessible to site visitors. Once the changes are tested and approved, they can be moved to the live website.
