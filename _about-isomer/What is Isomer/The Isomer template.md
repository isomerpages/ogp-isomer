### What is the Isomer template?
Isomer has a **pre-designed layout** that provides the structure for all websites built with Isomer. It includes lightweight components and templates that users can mix and match in various ways. 

You can also refer to our design academy website to get tips on ways to use the template, or refer to our cheatsheet to preview the possibilities of the Isomer template.

##### Does this mean that all Isomer websites look the same?

Not necessarily. By design, the Isomer template keeps a consistent *navigational* experience across all Isomer websites. This becomes familiar to site visitors and **helps them find the information they need quicker, regardless of whichever Isomer website they are on** since they donâ€™t have to re-learn how to use the website. They save time and frustration, and improves their overall experience.

In addition, it also makes it more accessible for users with disabilities. For example, users who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies to navigate websites can benefit from a consistent navigation structure, as it makes it easier for them to find and access content.

The Isomer template UI is derived from the Singapore Government Design System (SGDS) and follows their standards. Currently, users can set website colors, content, and order of components. We do not currently offer font or specific component styling customisations (e.g. round vs sharp corners, button styling etc.)

_\[Note that as of 2023 the template is following an older version of SGDS. The team is looking to realign in the future.\]_

Despite using the same Isomer template, our research has shown that site visitors do perceive Isomer websites differently and place greater importance on content than on specific styling.

We recommend users to visit our [design academy website](https://designacademy.isomer.gov.sg/) to learn how to use content more effectively to differentiate your website.
