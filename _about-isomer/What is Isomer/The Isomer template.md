### What is the Isomer template?
Isomer has a **pre-designed layout** that provides the structure for all websites built with Isomer. It includes lightweight components and templates that users can mix and match in various ways. 

This keeps a consistent navigation across all Isomer websites by design. **With familiarisation, visitors can find and locate information on any Isomer site quicker**, since they wouldnâ€™t have to re-learn how to use a website. This saves time and frustration, and improves the overall site experience.

Additionally, **it's more accessible for site visitors with disabilities.** For example, individuals who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies to navigate websites benefit from a consistent navigation structure. The repetition makes it easier for them to find and access content.

The template UI and its components are derived from the [Singapore Government Design System (SGDS)](https://www.designsystem.tech.gov.sg/), and follows their standards. 


##### Does this mean that all Isomer websites look the same?

Not necessarily. Our research has shown that site visitors do perceive Isomer websites differently, and can feel strongly about certain Isomer websites over others. **Despite them using the same template and components, content was a bigger differentiator in how they perceived the websites than any specific styling.**

Some interviewees even noted that they wouldn't have noticed the similarities if not for our research questions.
