> Isomer is a website builder for government agencies to launch static websites *easily and for free*.

It aims to empower the government to **easily and effectively communicate** with citizens, while enabling members of the public to **easily find information** they are looking for.

You can use Isomer and our CMS to create and manage your website. 

There are 3 parts to Isomer:
1. The Isomer template
2. Isomer's infrastructure
3. IsomerCMS

Our pre-designed **Isomer template** is hosted on our **infrastructure**, which can be edited through the **IsomerCMS**.

The Isomer team centrally manages the Isomer template and infrastructure, while **Public Officers only need to access the IsomerCMS to make edits to their website.**

Isomer is built and managed by [Open Government Products](https://open.gov.sg/)
