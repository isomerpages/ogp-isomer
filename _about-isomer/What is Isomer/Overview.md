&gt; Isomer is a website builder for government agencies to launch static websites *easily and for free*.

It aims to empower the government to **easily and effectively communicate** with citizens, while enabling members of the public to **easily find information** they are looking for.

You can use Isomer and our CMS to create and manage your website. There are 3 parts to Isomer:
1. [The Isomer template](/about-isomer/what-is-isomer/isomer-template/)
2. [Isomer's infrastructure](/about-isomer/what-is-isomer/isomer-infra/)
3. [IsomerCMS](/about-isomer/what-is-isomer/isomercms/)

Our pre-designed **templates** are hosted on our **infrastructure**, which can be edited through the **IsomerCMS**. 

The Isomer team centrally manages the Isomer template and infrastructure, while **officers only need to access IsomerCMS to make edits to your website.**
