> Isomer is a website builder for government agencies to launch static websites *easily and for free*.

It aims to empower the government to **easily and effectively communicate** with citizens, while enabling members of the public to **easily find information** they are looking for.

You can use Isomer and our CMS to create and manage your website. 

There are 3 parts to Isomer:
1. The Isomer template
2. Isomer's infrastructure
3. IsomerCMS

Our pre-designed **Isomer template** is hosted on our **infrastructure**, which can be edited through the **IsomerCMS**.

The Isomer team centrally manages the Isomer template and infrastructure, while **Public Officers only need to access the IsomerCMS to make edits to their website.**

Isomer is built and managed by [Open Government Products](https://open.gov.sg/)

### What is IsomerCMS?
[IsomerCMS](cms.isomer.gov.sg) stands for **Content Management System**. This is the platform through which Public Officers can make edits and publish changes to their websites themselves, without having to go through any third party.


#### What can I do on IsomerCMS?

- Create and manage site pages
- Edit page content
- Add or remove collaborators to your website
- Edit site settings
- Raise and approve review requests to publish changes
- Publish content in approved review requests

### What is the Isomer template?
The Isomer team centrally manages a template, which is a **pre-designed layout** that provides the structure for a website built with Isomer. It includes a set of pre-defined pages, sections, and elements that users can combine in various ways to make further customisations to better suit the needs of a particular website.

> As an analogy, the Isomer team has designed and made a bunch of lego blocks that you can stack and combine in various ways to create a structure.

The Isomer template is designed to be flexible and adaptable, so that it can be used for a wide range of website types. It provides a starting point for government agencies to build their websites, rather than starting from scratch.

This website is an example of a website using the Isomer template. You can also refer to our design academy website to get tips on ways to use the template, or refer to our cheatsheet to preview the possibilities of the Isomer template.

##### Does this mean that all Isomer websites look the same?

Not necessarily. By design, the Isomer template keeps a consistent navigational experience across all Isomer websites. This becomes familiar to site visitors and helps them find the information they need quicker, regardless of whichever Isomer website they are on since they donâ€™t have to re-learn how to use the website. This can save users time and frustration, and can also improve their overall experience.

In addition, it also makes it more accessible for users with disabilities. For example, users who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies to navigate websites can benefit from a consistent navigation structure, as it makes it easier for them to find and access content.

The Isomer template UI is derived from the Singapore Government Design System (SGDS) and follows their standards. Currently, users can set website colors, content, and order of components. We do not currently offer font or specific component styling customisations (e.g. round vs sharp corners, button styling etc.)

_\[Note that as of 2023 the template is following an older version of SGDS. The team is looking to realign in the future.\]_

Despite using the same Isomer template, our research has shown that site visitors do perceive Isomer websites differently and place greater importance on content than on specific styling.

We recommend users to visit our [design academy website](https://designacademy.isomer.gov.sg/) to learn how to use content more effectively to differentiate your website.
