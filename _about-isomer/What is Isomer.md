There are 3 parts to an Isomer website:
1. The Isomer template
2. Isomer's infrastructure
3. IsomerCMS

Our pre-designed **Isomer template** is hosted on our **infrastructure**, which can be edited through the **IsomerCMS**.

The Isomer team centrally manages the Isomer template and infrastructure, while **Public Officers only need to access the IsomerCMS to make edits to their website.**

### What is IsomerCMS?
[IsomerCMS](cms.isomer.gov.sg) stands for **Content Management System**. This is the platform through which Public Officers can make edits and publish changes to their websites themselves, without having to go through any third party.


#### What can I do on IsomerCMS?

- Create and manage site pages
- Edit page content
- Add or remove collaborators to your website
- Edit site settings
- Raise and approve review requests to publish changes
- Publish content in approved review requests
