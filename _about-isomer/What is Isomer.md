> Any public officer can build a good website


**Isomer mainly caters to static, informational websites.** Our team works on the belief that websites are important ways that the government shares information with citizens. As such, we want to help any public officer to set up a *good* website easily without any prior coding or design knowledge.


### The vision and mission
üè¢ Isomer aims to empower the government to easily and effectively communicate with citizens through our websites.

üë™ Citizens should be able to easily find and navigate information on Isomer websites.

We do this by making Isomer the de-facto website builder for the government ‚Äì which enables any public officer to create user-friendly, reliable, cost-effective, secure and fast websites.

### Our history
Isomer started as an [OGP hackathon project](https://hack.gov.sg/) in 2020. 

An internal study conducted by the Singapore government in 2017 found that over one-third of our government websites failed basic usability checks. Problems included website downtime, slow loading speed, and high cost. There was also poor website UX across different devices, and they were hard for citizens with visual disabilities to use.

**Isomer was created to provide government agencies with a simple and efficient way to create and host static websites.** With Isomer, agencies can easily build usable, secure, and fast informational websites without the need for extensive technical expertise or resources.

- Our website template has been pre-tested to ensure **usability and accessibility** for people with disabilities
- Our static site architecture is designed for **fast loading and eliminates many vulnerabilities**, providing a secure and reliable platform for your website
- We use automated monitoring to improve the **reliability and security** of your website, ensuring that it is always up-to-date and protected against potential threats
