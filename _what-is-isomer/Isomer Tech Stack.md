[Copied from Before you onboard]

*   **Isomer hosts all website content on Github – making them publicly available.** This includes the URL of your staging and production site. Isomer has [security measures](https://guide-cms.isomer.gov.sg/faq/security) to avoid unauthorized changes to your live site, and generally these links are hard to find unless specifically looked for. (?Repo privatisation?)
    
*   **Isomer does not support any form of Javascript or animations.** We are designed for informational and static websites only.
    
*   **Isomer has placed restrictions on certain actions to follow government compliance regulations,** such as disallowing the deletion of required pages (e.g. privacy, terms of use).
    
*   **Isomer uses [KeyCDN](https://www.keycdn.com/about) as our CDN provider** to make sure sites are always up. It also helps protect us against DDOS attacks. **(Is this necessary)**
    
*   **All content hosted on Isomer is passed to ~Netlify~ Amplify** to be deployed as staging and production sites, which is how staging links are produced. **(Is this necessary)**
