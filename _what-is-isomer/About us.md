### Any public officer can build a good website


Isomer mainly caters to static, informational websites. 


#### The vision and mission
 ðŸ‘‰ Isomer aims to empower the government to easily and effectively communicate with citizens through our websites.

Citizens should be able to easily find and navigate information on Isomer websites.

We do this by making Isomer the de-facto website builder for the government which enables any public officer to create user-friendly, reliable, cost-effective, secure and fast websites.

#### Our history
Isomer started as a hackathon project in 2020. 

An internal study conducted by the Singapore government in 2017 found that over one-third of our government websites failed basic usability checks. Problems included website downtime, slow loading speed, and high cost.  There was also noted to be poor website UX across devices, and it was hard for citizens with visual impairment to use.

Isomer provides government agencies with an easy-to-deploy static website building and hosting service to easily create usable, secure and fast informational websites.
