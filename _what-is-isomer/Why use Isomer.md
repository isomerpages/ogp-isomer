### 1. Bypass compliance

~~Shorten the timeline to launch by bypassing all these other needs:~~

- ##### No need for a tender or AOR
	Isomer is an internal government tool, meaning there is no need to set up a tender or AOR.

- ##### No need to do your own VAPT
	Since all sites on Isomer share the same infrastructure and pull from a central template, there is no need for multiple VAPTs or security reviews.

- ##### Be IM8 compliant by default
	We're compliant to all applicable Instruction Manual 8 (IM8) clauses and follow the recommended guidelines by the [Singapore Government Design System](https://designsystem.gov.sg/). 


### 2. Our website template gets you started fast
2. Our website template means you don't have to worry about designing a website from scratch

The Isomer team creates and manages the design for all Isomer sites, provides the hosting, and ensures that your site remains accessible, secure, and fast.

This model works very well for sites which are informational in nature such as corporate sites.

##### In line with Singapore Government Design System

Our site templates are designed based on components found on the [Singapore Government Design System](https://designsystem.tech.gov.sg/). If you choose to build a site on your own, you can still refer to the UI components found on their site.

_Note that the current components may not be up to date with the latest SGDS._

### 3. Make edits easily with our Content Management System (CMS)
CMS allows public officers to add, remove and edit content themselves without having to go through a third party.
