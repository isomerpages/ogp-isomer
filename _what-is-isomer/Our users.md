### Isomer in action – covid.gov.sg
During the Omnicron wave of COVID-19 in Singapore, Isomer was used by the OGP team to set up *covid.gov.sg* – A microsite to house all information regarding the then health protocols and next steps. This was specifically hosted outside of the main MOH corporate website to allow for more targetted information.

Instead of having to wait months as is typical for government procurement, Isomer allowed government agencies to build these websites in as little as 1.5 days, ensuring that citizens receive the latest information about the constantly evolving COVID-19 situation.

The site was live from 27 Sep 2022 to 13 Feb 2023.
