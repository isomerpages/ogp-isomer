### Isomer in action – covid.gov.sg
During the Omnicron wave of COVID-19 in Singapore, Isomer was used by the OGP team to set up *covid.gov.sg* – A microsite to house all information regarding the then health protocols and next steps. This was specifically hosted outside of the main MOH corporate website to allow for more targetted information. 

**With Isomer, the team was able to set up, populate, and launch covid.gov.sg within 4 days.** And it could have been even faster, but the team spent most of those 4 days gathering information to populate the site with. The site was live from 27 Sep 2022 to 13 Feb 2023.
