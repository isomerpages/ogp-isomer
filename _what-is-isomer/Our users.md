### Isomer in action â€“ covid.gov.sg
During the Omicron wave of COVID-19 in Singapore, the OGP team used Isomer to set up *covid.gov.sg*, a microsite that housed all information regarding health protocols and next steps. The site was hosted outside of the main MOH corporate website to allow for more targeted information.

**With Isomer, the team was able to set up, populate, and launch *covid.gov.sg* within just 4 days.** They used embedded CheckFirst checkers, FormSG forms, and an AskGov FAQ to divert people to appropriate information based on their particular situation, in a self-serve manner.

The website received 1 million visitors in its first month and was featured on all following COVID-19 communication channels, including print and digital media. **It received good feedback on its speed of updates on changing protocols, as well as its user-friendliness and ease-of-use in finding critical information.**

Isomer was also used to build website pages for other COVID-19 campaigns, such as *sgunited.gov.sg* and *safetravel.ica.gov.sg*. **Instead of waiting months for government procurement, Isomer allowed government agencies to build these websites in as little as 1.5 days,** ensuring that citizens received the latest information about the constantly evolving COVID-19 situation.

*covid.gov.sg* was live from September 27, 2021, to February 13, 2023.
