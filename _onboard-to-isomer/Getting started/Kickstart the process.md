While all whitelisted government emails are currently able to log into IsomerCMS through their emails, **currently it is not possible to create an Isomer website independently through IsomerCMS**. Public Officers need to fill in a form to create an Isomer website.

### Setting up your site

When you’re ready to get onboard Isomer:

1.  Create an account on&nbsp;[Github](https://www.github.com/). You can refer to the steps outlined on our guide&nbsp;[here](https://guide.isomer.gov.sg/)
2.  Send us request through&nbsp;[this contact form](https://go.gov.sg/isomer-contact/).
3.  We’ll generate a template for you
4.  Submit another form to gain access to your website and start editing on isomerCMS.

### Editing your site

To edit your site, you’ll have to log onto IsomerCMS. Before you do that, make sure that you’ve gotten access to your site. Otherwise, you will not see anything after logging in.

### Site launch

Let us know in advance (ideally 2 weeks) prior to when you’d like to launch the site. If you need the site to be up urgently, let us know when we’re onboarding you onto isomer so we can slot you in our launch schedule quickly.

You can read more about how to launch your website on our guide.
