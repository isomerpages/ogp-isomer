##### Read through this before deciding to onboard to Isomer
It's important to understand our limitations and ensure that we are a good fit for your use case. You can also [read our Onboarding FAQs]() for more information. 

Here are some key points to consider:


### What types of websites are suitable for Isomer?

##### **Isomer best caters to static websites. Characteristics of such websites include:**
    
✅ Content shown on the website is fixed and does not change unless the website owner manually updates it.   
✅ Contains unclassified content that is meant for public consumption.
    
**Common use cases include:**    
✅ **Informational websites:** Provide information to the public, such as information about government services, policies, and regulations using text and media such as images.   
✅ **Campaign websites:** Promote specific initiatives or programs.  
✅ **Corporate websites:** Provides information on an agency
    
Examples include: [towardszerowaste.gov.sg](https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/), boa.gov.sg, switchsg.org
    
##### **Characteristics of websites we do NOT cater for include:**
    
❌ User authentification where users are to “log in” to the service  
❌ Dynamic content where users can interact with a website to get personalised information  
❌ Native interactive elements such as calculators or maps (Note that some such services can be embedded onto Isomer websites, such as data.gov.sg or CheckFirst.gov.sg)  
❌ Calls to a database to store and retrieve information  
❌ Server-side processing???*
    
**Common use cases with these chracteristics include:**  
❌ **Web applications:** Dynamic websites that allow users to interact with the website and perform specific tasks, such as filling out forms or making payments.  
❌ **E-commerce websites:** Allow users to purchase goods or services online. This includes selling products or services, such as park passes or event tickets.  
❌ **Data visualization platforms:** Allow users to explore and interact with data in a visual way using maps or charts.
    
Examples include: cpf.gov.sg, iras.gov.sg

> Note that some services, while not controlled from within IsomerCMS, can be embedded onto an Isomer page such as FormSG forms and CheckFirst checkers.

### What are my agency's responsibilities for a website hosted on Isomer?

Agencies are responsible for all content, management and maintenance of your Isomer website. This includes:

- Migrating any content from an old website to a new Isomer website
- Updating and creating content such as text or images
- Approving and publishing any content changes
- Ensuring that your website content meets content-related standards in DSS
- Maintaining access rights to the editing of your website and regularly removing inactive users

These can be done through our Content Management System, IsomerCMS. [Learn more about IsomerCMS]()

Isomer will be responsible for website hosting, maintenance, support and ensuring compliance to relevant clauses of the IM8, DSS and UC. We are here to ensure that your website is up and running smoothly, and we provide technical support if you encounter any issues.

Isomer also provides the following services:

*   Technical support and assistance with usage of IsomerCMS through our support channels
*   Training of how to use IsomerCMS on request

> We do not offer website design services, and are unable to provide custom designs or layouts for your website.

Instead, Isomer maintains a central template that offers some basic customisation that users can leverage on to begin building their website.


### Other considerations

- **Isomer does not support any form of Javascript or animations.**&nbsp;We are designed for informational and static websites only.
- **We limit each image or file size uploaded to IsomerCMS to 5MB** to ensure fast loading times, but you can upload larger files to [go.gov.sg](https://go.gov.sg/#/) and link to them on a page.
- **Agencies can only use [IsomerCMS](cms.isomer.gov.sg) to edit their websites.** Users only have to visit Github is to raise a [pull request](https://guide.isomer.gov.sg/guide/publish-your-changes).
- We can create subdomain sites if requested. Noted, we can create a site for you as you've shared that the site will be hosted on the domain that you've share.
    

### Support and cost 
- The Isomer platform and service is free for Public Officers to use, but in order to launch their site, **agencies must bear the cost of the domain URL**, which you can procure from IT Service Management (ITSM).

- Isomer allows Public officers to add vendors as collaborators to their website, but **agencies are responsible for all communication with and actions of their vendors.** The Isomer team will not directly liaise with any vendors. [View our FAQs on vendor management]()

- **Agencies are responsible for migrating any existing content from a previous website** to their Isomer website. The Isomer team cannot provide this service for you.

- Isomer Support is able to help with technical assistance of the CMS and simple markdown or HTML debugging, **but does not entertain debugging requests for complex customisations of the Isomer template CSS.**

- Each website should have at least 2 Public Officers added to it. To publish changes to your website, a colleague needs to approve your changes. The Isomer team does not do this approval for you. [Learn more about review requests]()


### Compliance
- **Agencies do not need to be responsible for any IM8 clauses. By using Isomer, your site is _by default compliant_ to all applicable IM8 clauses.** The Isomer Team manages all security centrally, including any security testing (i.e. VAPT etc) and audits/tests. In the event that any IM8-related queries come along, we will sort it out separately with the IM8 team. 
You can reach out to [Isomer Support](mailto:%20support@isomer.gov.sg) for further clarification on specific clauses.
- Internal Risk Assessment Checklist is not applicable to Isomer (?) as part of the security review for compliance with IM8

- **Isomer has placed restrictions on certain actions to follow government compliance regulations,** such as disallowing the deletion of required pages (e.g. privacy, terms of use).
