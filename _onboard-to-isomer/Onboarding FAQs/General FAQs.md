### What is a static website?

There a 2 broad categories of websites – static vs dynamic.

##### Static VS dynamic websites

**Static websites** uses files that are pre-built and served without change from the server, like showing a Microsoft word document or a PDF to someone.

To use an analogy, it’s like a printed brochure that you pick up from a store. The content doesn’t change unless someone re-prints it and you pick up a new one the next time you visit the store.

**Dynamic websites** are being dynamically generated with each incoming request and are changed on the server before being served. They usually need a database and server patches since there are complicated server-side scripts or processes running for your webpage to be rendered on a browser.

To use an analogy, it’s like going for a hair cut at a salon. The stylist can personalise the cut to your hair type and style preferences, or provide recommendations for haircuts, colors, and treatments that are tailored to your hair type and face shape. They will also adjust their techniques along the way based on your feedback.

Overall, the main difference between a static and dynamic website is that a static website is simple and fixed, while being cheaper, faster, and more secure. Whereas a dynamic website is more complex and interactive, but is costly and harder to maintain.

##### How are static websites faster?

On static websites, pages are pre-rendered and stored in a Content Delivery Network (CDN) instead of being dynamically generated from the server like on dynamic websites. This means that pages don't have to be created every time someone wants to view them, making them faster than sites that have to be generated on-the-go. Static sites usually have simpler structures and use fewer resources, allowing them to load quickly even on slower connections.

This is also why Isomer has established limits on the size of media and files uploaded. Larger files take longer to load and directly affect the loading speed of a website.

##### How are static websites more secure?

The Isomer team regularly conducts Vulnerability Assessment Penetration Testing (VAPT) on the Isomer template. We ensure that only whitelisted scripts are able to run on your sites, which is managed by a central template and infrastructure that all Isomer websites use. Therefore, we do not allow custom scripts to run on Isomer sites.

Moreover, the Isomer Team monitors your sites 24/7 and has set up alarms and procedures to ensure that team members are always on call to immediately attend to any downtime of your sites.
