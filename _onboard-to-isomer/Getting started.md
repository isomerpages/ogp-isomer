- Submit another form to gain access to your website.

##### 2. Log into [cms.isomer.gov.sg](https://cms.isomer.gov.sg/sites) to start editing

### Important info to know before you onboard


*   Isomer is an **informational static website builder** which means Isomer is unable to support any Javascripts or animation required on the website.
    

*   2.
    
    Upon onboarding, we strongly recommend you try out the CMS to see if it suits your use case.
    

*   3.
    
    Isomer can only able to accept files/image up to 5MB
    

*   4.
    
    All edits and configurations have to be done **on the CMS**. The only time Isomer users have to visit Github is to raise [pull requests](https://guide.isomer.gov.sg/guide/publish-your-changes).
    

*   5.
    
    Enquiries sent to support@isomer.gov.sg will take about 3-5 working days to respond as our team operates in a lean manner. You may also look at the guide on some of the FAQs to get answers to your enquiry.
    

*   6.
    
    Agencies hiring vendors to help with their website development must get a government email to access [Isomer](/isomer-announcements). FAQ [here](/faq/vendor-management).
    

*   7.
    
    The Isomer team has put in a place several restrictions on what you can or cannot do on the CMS concerning compliance. For example, if you wish to delete pages but you're not able to, that just means you're not allowed to delete those pages. A few examples are the privacy and terms of use page which you're not allowed to delete.
    

*   8.
    
    Onboarding to Isomer is free, the only items you are required to pay for are the domain URL and custom SSL.
    
    *   1.
        
        Alternatively, you may wish to onboard to the free Isomer provisioned '[LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/about/)' SSL cert, it lasts 3 months and auto-renew itself at the end of every cycle, which means it last 'forever' along with your Isomer site.
        
    
    *   2.
        
        If you wish to use LetsEncrypt, you may let the team know when your site is ready to launch.
        
    

*   9.
    
    Isomer comes with a monitoring system to monitor whether the website is up or down using [uptime-robot](https://uptimerobot.com/).
    

*   10.
    
    Isomer is using [KeyCDN](https://www.keycdn.com/about) as our CDN provider to make sure sites are always up and it also serves as a protection to DDOS attack
    

*   11.
    
    All website contents of Isomer are hosted on [Github](https://github.com/about). This means, all contents and information uploaded by users will be available on the internet including the URL of your **staging and production site**. However, the chances of public users finding the content is relatively low and we have also put up security measures to avoid random users from pushing changes to your live site. You may read more about it [here](https://guide-cms.isomer.gov.sg/faq/security).‌
    

*   12.
    
    All the contents hosted on Isomer will be passed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to be deployed as staging and production sites. Netlify acts as a virtual server to serve the content from Github to an informational site which is how staging links were being produced.
    

*   13.
    
    You may click [here](/publish-changes-and-site-launch/new-site-launch/what-to-expect-for-site-launch) to find out what should you expect for the site launch.
    

*   14.
    
    If you have any doubts, do refer to the guide or may choose to seek clarification with us at [support@isomer.gov.sg](mailto:%20support@isomer.gov.sg)

### Setting up your site

### Editing your site

To edit your site, you’ll have to log onto IsomerCMS. Before you do that, make sure that you’ve gotten access to your site. Otherwise, you will not see anything after logging in.

### Site launch

Let us know in advance (ideally 2 weeks) prior to when you’d like to launch the site. If you need the site to be up urgently, let us know when we’re onboarding you onto isomer so we can slot you in our launch schedule quickly.
