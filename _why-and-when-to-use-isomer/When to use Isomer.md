##### Isomer caters best to static websites, which is where:

- Content shown on the website is fixed and does not change unless the website owner manually updates it.   
- Contains unclassified content that is meant for public consumption.
    
**Common use cases include:**    
- **Informational websites:** Provide information to the public, such as information about government services, policies, and regulations using text and media such as images.   
- **Campaign websites:** Promote specific initiatives or programs.  
- **Corporate websites:** Provides information on an agency
    
Examples include: [Towards Zero Waste campaign website](https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/), [Board of Architects Corporate website](https://www.boa.gov.sg/), [Singapore Week of Innovation & Technology event website](https://www.switchsg.org/)
    
##### Isomer is not ideal for websites that include:
    
- User authentification where users have to 'log in' to the service  
- Website content that can be personalised and interacted with by users to obtain customised information.  
- Any calls to a database for storing or retrieving information using an API or any form of server-side processing.  
- Specialised widgets such as calculators or maps.  
	- The exception is being able to embed certain services and tools such as FormSG forms and CheckFirst checkers. Isomer also allows chatbots such as VICA or AskJamie. These are managed and configured outside of IsomerCMS. 

    
**Common use cases with these chracteristics include:**  
- **Web applications:** Dynamic websites that allow users to interact with the website and perform specific tasks, such as filling out forms or making payments.  
- **E-commerce websites:** Allow users to purchase goods or services online. This includes selling products or services, such as park passes or event tickets.  
- **Data visualization platforms:** Allow users to explore and interact with data in a visual way using maps or charts.
    
Examples include: [CPF Portal](https://cpf.gov.sg/), [IRAS Portal](https://iras.gov.sg/), [EDB Portal](https://portal.edb.gov.sg/)
