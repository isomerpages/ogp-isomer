### What types of websites are suitable for Isomer?

##### Isomer best caters to static websites. Characteristics of such websites include:
    
✅ Content shown on the website is fixed and does not change unless the website owner manually updates it.   
✅ Contains unclassified content that is meant for public consumption.
    
**Common use cases include:**    
✅ **Informational websites:** Provide information to the public, such as information about government services, policies, and regulations using text and media such as images.   
✅ **Campaign websites:** Promote specific initiatives or programs.  
✅ **Corporate websites:** Provides information on an agency
    
Examples include: [towardszerowaste.gov.sg](https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/), [boa.gov.sg](https://www.boa.gov.sg/), [switchsg.org](https://www.switchsg.org/)
    
##### **Characteristics of websites we do NOT cater for include:**
    
❌ User authentification where users have to 'log in' to the service  
❌ Website content that can be personalized and interacted with by users to obtain customized information.  
❌ Specialised widgets such as calculators or maps.** However, you can embed some services onto an Isomer page, and we allow chatbots such as VICA or AskJamie.  
❌ Any calls to a database for storing or retrieving information using an API or any form of server-side processing.
    
**Common use cases with these chracteristics include:**

❌ **E-commerce websites:** Allow users to purchase goods or services online. This includes selling products or services, such as park passes or event tickets.  
❌ **Data visualization platforms:** Allow users to explore and interact with data in a visual way using maps or charts.
