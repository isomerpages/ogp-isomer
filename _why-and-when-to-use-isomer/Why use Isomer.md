Isomer believes that websites are an important way for the government to share information with citizens. As such, we want to enable any public officer to **set up a good website easily without any prior coding or design knowledge.** Here's how Isomer makes it easy:

### 1. It meets all compliance requirements

- ##### No need for a tender or AOR
	Because Isomer is an internal government tool, the service is free to use.

- ##### No need to do your own VAPT
	Since all sites on Isomer share the same infrastructure and pull from a central template, there is no need for multiple VAPTs or security reviews.

- ##### IM8 compliant by default
	Just by using Isomer, you've already covered all applicable Instruction Manual 8 (IM8) clauses and follow the recommended guidelines by the [Singapore Government Design System](https://designsystem.gov.sg/). 

All of this helps when you need to launch a website quickly. 

### 2. Standard templates for quick launch

Don't worry about designing a website entirely from scratch. You can use our pre-design sections and components, and arrange them in ways to suite your needs. Think of it like us providing you lego blocks to build your own lego house!


##### In line with Singapore Government Design System (SGDS)

Our template components reference and follow the standards set by the [Singapore Government Design System](https://designsystem.tech.gov.sg/). This means that using our template ensures that you are following good user interface and user experience practices.

_Note that the current components may not be up to date with the latest version of SGDS. The team is looking to realign in the future._ 

### 3. Easy-to-use CMS to manage your content

IsomerCMS (Content Management System) allows public officers to add, edit and publish content themselves without having to go through a third party.
