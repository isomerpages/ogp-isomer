### 1. Bypass compliance

This helps when you need to launch a website quickly. Here's how we'll speed up the process for you:

- ##### No need for a tender or AOR
	Isomer is an internal government tool, meaning there is no need to set up a tender or AOR.

- ##### No need to do your own VAPT
	Since all sites on Isomer share the same infrastructure and pull from a central template, there is no need for multiple VAPTs or security reviews.

- ##### IM8 compliant by default
	We're compliant to all applicable Instruction Manual 8 (IM8) clauses and follow the recommended guidelines by the [Singapore Government Design System](https://designsystem.gov.sg/). 


### 2. Start fast with our website template
Don't worry about designing a website entirely from scratch. You can use our pre-design sections and components, and arrange them in ways to suite your needs. Think of it like us providing you lego blocks to build your own lego house!


##### In line with Singapore Government Design System (SGDS)

Our template components reference and follow the standards set by the [Singapore Government Design System](https://designsystem.tech.gov.sg/). This means that using our template ensures that you are following good user interface and user experience practices.

_Note that the current components may not be up to date with the latest version of SGDS. The team is looking to realign in the future._ 

### 3. Make edits easily with our CMS
IsomerCMS (Content Management System) allows public officers to add, remove and edit content themselves without having to go through a third party.
