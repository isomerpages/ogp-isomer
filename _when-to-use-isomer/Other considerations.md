### Other considerations

- **Isomer does not support any form of Javascript or animations.**&nbsp;We are designed for informational and static websites only.
- **We limit each image or file size uploaded to IsomerCMS to 5MB** to ensure fast loading times, but you can upload larger files to [go.gov.sg](https://go.gov.sg/#/) and link to them on a page.
- **Agencies can only use [IsomerCMS](cms.isomer.gov.sg) to edit their websites.** Users only have to visit Github is to raise a [pull request](https://guide.isomer.gov.sg/guide/publish-your-changes).
- We can create subdomain sites if requested. Noted, we can create a site for you as you've shared that the site will be hosted on the domain that you've share.
