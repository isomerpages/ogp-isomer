There are 2 broad categories of websites – **static** and **dynamic**

##### Static VS dynamic websites

**Static websites use files that are pre-built and served without change from the server,** like showing someone a Microsoft word document or a PDF.

- To use an analogy, it’s like a printed brochure that you pick up from a store. The content doesn’t change unless someone re-prints it and you pick up a new one the next time you visit the store.

**Dynamic websites are re-generated each time someone visits the the website.** They're changed on the server before being served. They often require a database and server updates because there are complex scripts or processes that run on the server to display the website on a browser.

- To use an analogy, it’s like going for a hair cut at a salon. The stylist can personalise the cut to your hair type and style preferences, or provide recommendations for haircuts, colors, and treatments that are tailored to your hair type and face shape. They can also adjust their techniques along the way based on your feedback.

A static website is simple and fixed, while being cheaper, faster, and more secure. Whereas a dynamic website is more complex and interactive, but is costly and harder to maintain.

Isomer caters to static websites. [Read more about the benefits of having a static site](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/5-reasons-static-sites-rock).

##### How are static websites faster?

**Static websites are pre-rendered and stored in a Content Delivery Network (CDN)**, unlike dynamic websites that are generated every time someone wants to view them. This makes them faster and simpler as they use fewer resources, and loads quickly even on slower connections.

**Isomer limits the size of media and files uploaded.** Larger files take longer to load and directly affect the loading speed of a website.

##### How are static websites more secure?

Isomer regularly conducts Vulnerability Assessment Penetration Testing (VAPT). **Only whitelisted scripts are allowed to run on your sites,** which is managed centrally by the Isomer team. We do not allow custom scripts to run on any Isomer site.

**Isomer also monitors your sites 24/7.** The team has set up alarms and procedures to ensure that team members are on call to immediately attend to any sites that go down.
