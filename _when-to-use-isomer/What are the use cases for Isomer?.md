##### Isomer caters best to static websites, which is where:

- Content shown on the website is fixed and does not change unless the website owner manually updates it.   
- Contains unclassified content that is meant for public consumption.

**Common use cases include:**    
- **Informational websites:** Provide information to the public, such as information about government services, policies, and regulations using text and media such as images.   
- **Campaign websites:** Promote specific initiatives or programs.  
- **Corporate websites:** Provides information on an agency
    
	Examples include: [Towards Zero Waste campaign website](https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/), [Board of Architects Corporate website](https://www.boa.gov.sg/), [Singapore Week of Innovation & Technology event website](https://www.switchsg.org/)
    
##### Isomer is not ideal for websites that include:
    
- User authentification where users have to 'log in' to the service  
- Website content that can be personalised and interacted with by users to obtain customised information.  
- Any calls to a database for storing or retrieving information using an API or any form of server-side processing.  
- Use of Javascript or animations 
- Specialised widgets such as custom calculators or maps. 
	- However, Isomer does allow some [advanced integrations](/when-to-use-isomer/advance-integrations/).

    
**Common use cases include:**  
- **Web applications:** Dynamic websites that allow users to interact with the website and perform specific tasks, such as filling out forms or making payments.  
- **E-commerce websites:** Allow users to purchase goods or services online. This includes selling products or services, such as park passes or event tickets.  
- **Data visualisation platforms:** Allow users to explore and interact with data in a visual way using maps or charts.
    
	Examples include: [CPF Portal](https://cpf.gov.sg/), [IRAS Portal](https://iras.gov.sg/), [EDB Portal](https://portal.edb.gov.sg/)
	
	
- **We limit each image or file size uploaded to IsomerCMS to 5MB** to ensure fast loading times, but you can upload larger files to [go.gov.sg](https://go.gov.sg/#/) and link to them on a page.
