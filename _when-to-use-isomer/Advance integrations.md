&gt; Embed services and tools to extend the capabilities of a page 

You can use some outside services by putting them on a page on your website. These services are managed and set up outside of IsomerCMS.

To embed an external web page or document within a web page, use an iframe. An iframe loads content from a separate URL and displays it within a frame on the web page, allowing you to show content from external sources.

**Isomer maintains a whitelist of certain services that can be embedded for security reasons.**
